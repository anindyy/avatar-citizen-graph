- There are friend duplicates, you have to clean them
  before displaying it
- The data isn't consistent. Some included the person
  themselves in the friends list, some doesn't.
- Temen-temennya ga konsisten. Misal di datanya A, dia
  temenan sama B, tapi di data B dia ga temenan sama A.
  One sided friend dong :)

- gedein canvas graphnya, please.
  i guess it has some resizing problems too
- tambahin action kalo klik graph
- kalo ID-nya 3, item already exist
  ID 3 already exist karena keulang di friends
- terus item already exist ini sering kena gitu knp y
  i think it got to do with the graph
  it cant rewrite itself
- ngga bisa resubmit angka yang sama
- tambahin arrow di edgesnya
  cek repeating nodes aja? repeating edges gaakan kejadian
  kalo edgesnya dipanahin
- gedein canvasnya masih maksa (belum resizable)
- what do i do when the same node gets clicked twice?
  it results in repeating edges
- node yang keulang juga masih kejadiann
- viewnya masih ngadat ey
